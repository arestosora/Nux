## Self host.

You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed in your system. Once this is covered, you just need to run the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arestosora/Alya.git
```
> [!TIP]
> I recommend using yarn, but you can still use npm to install the dependencies.
```bash
yarn install
```
Then we must create our .env file, you can run the following command.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill the required fields.
> [!WARNING]
> You must have a Spotify application, you can create one [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

With everything complete, we must run docker and then 
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
or if you want to run it on the background

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
